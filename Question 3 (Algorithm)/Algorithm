Read the two input numbers.
Initialize variables to hold the sum and the carry value.
Iterate through the digits of the numbers from right to left:
	->Extract the last digit from each number.
	->Add the digits along with the carry value.
	->Calculate the new carry value.
	->Append the resulting digit to the sum.
If there is a remaining carry after the iteration, append it to the sum.
Reverse the sum to obtain the final result.
Output the sum of the numbers.
